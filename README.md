# The Pack Rat v0.5.1
> The Pack Rat is a basic web scraping utility that can be used to fetch and compile information like emails, phone numbers, images, and various other media that renders on a targetted URL. It will fetch every instance of the specified information it locates, and print it to stdout. Future updates will change this to allow the user to export this data to other formats (CSV, SQLite, JSON, etc.).

## Usage
```
python3 thepackrat.py -u [URL] -d [DATA-PREFERENCE]
```
