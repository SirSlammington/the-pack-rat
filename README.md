# The Pack Rat v1.0
> The Pack Rat is a basic web scraping utility that can be used to fetch and compile information like emails, phone numbers, images, and various other media that renders on a targetted URL page. Note that this will *only* fetch targets that render on a web pageâ€”if you require a tool that can enumerate through an entire domain, you would do well to look for a spider program.
